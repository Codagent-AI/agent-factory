## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Configure deployment without Codagent-specific controller code

The factory SHALL use TOML configuration for GitHub organization and repository identities, Project destinations, routing rules including native issue types per work kind, request labels, field and option mappings, repository locations, evaluation defaults, fix defaults, schedule, supervision limits, minimum free disk space, memory reservation, evidence retention, and local storage paths. Fix configuration SHALL include, per target repository, the mirror location and the operator's working clone path; and globally the branch names for the target, Runner, and Skills (default `main`), fix role profiles, fix limits, the fix admission window, the fix credential file location, the fix execution mode (`docker` by default, or `host`), and an optional fix-specific minimum free disk space that defaults to the shared minimum. Feature configuration SHALL include the feature role profiles, feature limits, the feature admission window, and the feature workflow contract; the feature kind SHALL use the fix targets, branch names, and fix credential. Handoff and admission of new feature work SHALL be enabled only when the feature configuration is present; when it is removed, existing feature claims SHALL continue to be supervised, reported, synced after merge, cleaned up, and pruned. The feature kind SHALL accept only host execution; configuration selecting Docker or Fly execution for it SHALL be rejected when configuration loads. Task configuration SHALL include the native task type in routing configuration (default `Task`), the task role profiles (lead, implementor, tester, crosscheck), the task workflow contract (default `factory-task/1`), task limits, the task admission window, and an optional task-specific minimum free disk space; the task kind SHALL use the fix targets, branch names, and fix credential. Handoff and admission of new task work SHALL be enabled only when the shared task configuration is present; when it is removed, existing task claims SHALL continue to be supervised, reported, synced after merge, cleaned up, and pruned. The task kind SHALL accept only host execution; configuration selecting Docker or Fly execution for it SHALL be rejected when configuration loads. The eval kind SHALL accept `docker` (the default) or `fly` execution and SHALL NOT accept host execution. Fly configuration SHALL be local and SHALL include the Fly app, region (default `ewr`), Machine CPU kind, CPU count, and memory (default shared, 4 CPUs, 8 GiB), the sandbox image reference, the deploy-token file location alongside the other controller credentials, and the collection grace period. The execution mode, fix disk floor, Fly settings, and retention period SHALL be local configuration. It SHALL supply Codagent as an example deployment configuration whose eval role defaults are `lead = claude:opus:medium`, `implementor = codex:gpt-5.6-luna:medium`, and `tester = codex:gpt-5.6-luna:medium`, and which enables the feature kind with role defaults matching its fix role defaults and the task kind with a Sonnet-class lead. The controller SHALL use configured mappings for logical queue states rather than require literal column names such as Ready or Review. An admission window whose start hour equals its stop hour SHALL be always open.

Another organization SHALL be able to deploy the supported factory behavior using its own configuration and credentials without modifying core controller code. Suite-specific and workflow-specific repository and executable locations SHALL be supplied to the relevant handler rather than embedded as Codagent or personal-machine assumptions in the controller. GitHub Projects, SQLite, one worker, and the Mac launchd service SHALL remain the supported initial deployment choices; this requirement does not introduce interchangeable providers.

#### Scenario: Configure another organization's Project

- **WHEN** an operator supplies a different organization, repositories, Project destination, request label, and mappings for queued and review states
- **THEN** routing and execution use those configured identities and mappings without requiring Codagent names or controller changes

#### Scenario: Supply the Codagent deployment

- **WHEN** an operator uses the supplied Codagent example configuration
- **THEN** it establishes the Eval, Bug, Feature, and Task behavior and the field names, options, and defaults described by the active specifications

#### Scenario: Configure fix targets

- **WHEN** an operator configures five target repositories with mirror and working-clone paths and leaves branches unset
- **THEN** fixes resolve `main` for each repository and the merge sync targets each configured working clone

#### Scenario: Leave the execution mode unset

- **WHEN** the local configuration names no fix execution mode
- **THEN** fixes run in the sandbox exactly as before this change

#### Scenario: Leave the eval execution mode unset

- **WHEN** the local configuration names no eval execution mode
- **THEN** evals run under Docker exactly as before this change and no Fly setting is required

#### Scenario: Configure host execution for evals

- **WHEN** the local configuration requests host execution for the eval kind
- **THEN** the factory reports the unsupported setting at startup and in doctor and admits no eval

#### Scenario: Configure Fly execution for evals

- **WHEN** the local configuration requests `fly` execution for the eval kind with an app, image, and deploy-token location and leaves the region, size, and grace unset
- **THEN** evals run in Fly Machines in `ewr` at shared 4 CPUs and 8 GiB with the default collection grace, and startup reports any missing required Fly setting

#### Scenario: Configure Docker execution for features

- **WHEN** the configuration selects Docker or Fly execution for the feature kind
- **THEN** configuration loading fails and names the unsupported mode

#### Scenario: Leave the feature kind unconfigured

- **WHEN** the configuration has no feature section
- **THEN** no Feature-typed issue is handed off or admitted and the other kinds behave as before

#### Scenario: Remove the feature section with feature claims in flight

- **WHEN** the feature section is removed while one feature attempt is running and another feature claim is settled with an open pull request
- **THEN** the running attempt is still supervised and its result reported, the settled claim still receives review rounds, merge sync, and cleanup, and no new feature is handed off or admitted

#### Scenario: Leave the task kind unconfigured

- **WHEN** the configuration has no task section
- **THEN** no Task-typed issue is handed off or admitted and the other kinds behave as before

#### Scenario: Configure Docker execution for tasks

- **WHEN** the configuration selects Docker or Fly execution for the task kind
- **THEN** configuration loading fails and names the unsupported mode

#### Scenario: Leave task settings at their defaults

- **WHEN** the shared configuration has a task section with role profiles only and the local configuration sets nothing for tasks
- **THEN** tasks use issue type `Task`, contract `factory-task/1`, host execution, an always-open window, and limits of 15 minutes without progress, two hours of execution, and three hours in total

#### Scenario: Reject a malformed task section

- **WHEN** the task section's defaults or limits have a value of the wrong type
- **THEN** configuration loading fails and names the offending task setting

#### Scenario: Remove the task section with task claims in flight

- **WHEN** the task section is removed while one task attempt is running and another task claim is settled with an open pull request
- **THEN** the running attempt is still supervised and its result reported, the settled claim still receives review rounds, merge sync, and cleanup, and no new task is handed off or admitted
