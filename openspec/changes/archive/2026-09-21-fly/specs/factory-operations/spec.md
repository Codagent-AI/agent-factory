## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Configure deployment without Codagent-specific controller code

The factory SHALL use TOML configuration for GitHub organization and repository identities, Project destinations, routing rules including native issue types and bypass markers per work kind, request labels, field and option mappings, repository locations, evaluation defaults, fix defaults, schedule, supervision limits, minimum free disk space, memory reservation, evidence retention, and local storage paths. Fix configuration SHALL include, per target repository, the mirror location and the operator's working clone path; and globally the branch names for the target, Runner, and Skills (default `main`), fix role profiles, fix limits, the fix admission window, the fix credential file location, the fix execution mode (`docker` by default, or `host`), and an optional fix-specific minimum free disk space that defaults to the shared minimum. The eval kind SHALL accept `docker` (the default) or `fly` execution and SHALL NOT accept host execution. Fly configuration SHALL be local and SHALL include the Fly app, region (default `ewr`), Machine CPU kind, CPU count, and memory (default shared, 4 CPUs, 8 GiB), the sandbox image reference, the deploy-token file location alongside the other controller credentials, and the collection grace period. The execution mode, fix disk floor, Fly settings, and retention period SHALL be local configuration. It SHALL supply Codagent as an example deployment configuration whose eval role defaults are `lead = claude:opus:medium`, `implementor = codex:gpt-5.6-luna:medium`, and `tester = codex:gpt-5.6-luna:medium`. The controller SHALL use configured mappings for logical queue states rather than require literal column names such as Ready or Review. An admission window whose start hour equals its stop hour SHALL be always open.

Another organization SHALL be able to deploy the supported factory behavior using its own configuration and credentials without modifying core controller code. Suite-specific and workflow-specific repository and executable locations SHALL be supplied to the relevant handler rather than embedded as Codagent or personal-machine assumptions in the controller. GitHub Projects, SQLite, one worker, and the Mac launchd service SHALL remain the supported initial deployment choices; this requirement does not introduce interchangeable providers.

#### Scenario: Configure another organization's Project

- **WHEN** an operator supplies a different organization, repositories, Project destination, request label, and mappings for queued and review states
- **THEN** routing and execution use those configured identities and mappings without requiring Codagent names or controller changes

#### Scenario: Supply the Codagent deployment

- **WHEN** an operator uses the supplied Codagent example configuration
- **THEN** it establishes the Eval and Bug behavior and the field names, options, and defaults described by the active specifications

#### Scenario: Configure fix targets

- **WHEN** an operator configures five target repositories with mirror and working-clone paths and leaves branches unset
- **THEN** fixes resolve `main` for each repository and the merge sync targets each configured working clone

#### Scenario: Leave the execution mode unset

- **WHEN** the local configuration names no fix execution mode
- **THEN** fixes run in the sandbox exactly as before this change

#### Scenario: Leave the eval execution mode unset

- **WHEN** the local configuration names no eval execution mode
- **THEN** evals run under Docker exactly as before this change and no Fly setting is required

#### Scenario: Configure host execution for evals

- **WHEN** the local configuration requests host execution for the eval kind
- **THEN** the factory reports the unsupported setting at startup and in doctor and admits no eval

#### Scenario: Configure Fly execution for evals

- **WHEN** the local configuration requests `fly` execution for the eval kind with an app, image, and deploy-token location and leaves the region, size, and grace unset
- **THEN** evals run in Fly Machines in `ewr` at shared 4 CPUs and 8 GiB with the default collection grace, and startup reports any missing required Fly setting

### Requirement: Diagnose readiness with doctor

`agent-factory doctor` SHALL check GitHub authentication and required access, configured Project fields and options, required model authentication, repository/worktree availability, selected-suite readiness, required token environment files, and free disk space against each kind's configured minimum. It SHALL group checks as shared, eval, eval-sandbox, eval-fly, fix-sandbox, or fix-host and label each so the operator can see which kind a failure holds; the eval group holds the mode-neutral eval checks that apply under every eval execution mode. It SHALL run only the groups that apply to a kind under its configured execution mode. Docker availability, memory allowance against one reservation, sandbox launcher checks, and reclaimable Docker space SHALL be checked and reported only under kinds configured for Docker execution; when no kind is configured for Docker, doctor SHALL neither probe Docker nor print any Docker line. The eval-fly group SHALL verify that the Fly API is reachable with the configured deploy token, the configured app exists, the configured image resolves to an immutable digest, the deploy-token file is owner-readable and contains only that token, the factory's own Fly launcher is resolvable, and `flyctl` is executable on the service PATH for transport. The factory SHALL resolve its launcher from the service PATH when present and otherwise from the directory holding the running factory, so that a service started without a bespoke PATH entry still finds the launcher shipped with it. For the fix kind it SHALL additionally verify that each target mirror can be fetched, each configured working clone exists and is a Git repository, the fix credential file is owner-readable, contains exactly one repository token variable and no other variable, authenticates, reaches each target repository, and is not the controller's own identity nor an organization administrator, and the packaged fix and review workflows each declare a compatible contract version. In host mode it SHALL verify, against the service environment, that the installed Agent Runner, `git`, `gh`, `jq`, `python3`, and the validator are executable, that each CLI selected by the fix roles is authenticated and carries the codagent plugin, and that the operator's Runner user settings select the headless backend and yolo permission mode. When a kind is configured for Docker and Docker is running it SHALL report the space Docker could reclaim and the command that reclaims it, without running that command. It SHALL distinguish available prerequisites from problems needing operator action, explain each failed check, and print no action on a passing check. Diagnosis SHALL NOT launch an attempt, create a Machine, or attempt to repair credentials or configuration.

Shared diagnostics SHALL remain distinct from checks supplied by each work kind and suite.

#### Scenario: Diagnose an unavailable prerequisite

- **WHEN** the operator runs doctor with Docker stopped under a Docker-configured kind, invalid required authentication, or an invalid Project mapping
- **THEN** doctor identifies the affected prerequisite and explains what needs attention without starting an attempt

#### Scenario: Diagnose suite readiness

- **WHEN** generic factory prerequisites are available but the selected suite's required entry-point or fixture files are unavailable
- **THEN** doctor identifies the suite-specific readiness problem separately from the available factory prerequisites

#### Scenario: Diagnose fix readiness

- **WHEN** the fix credential is missing, contains additional variables, or the packaged fix or review workflow lacks a compatible contract
- **THEN** doctor reports the fix-specific problem and shows eval readiness independently

#### Scenario: Diagnose Docker with fixes on the host

- **WHEN** Docker is stopped, the eval kind is configured for Docker execution, and the fix kind is configured for host execution
- **THEN** doctor reports Docker as an eval-sandbox problem and reports the fix kind ready when its host checks pass

#### Scenario: Run doctor with no kind on Docker

- **WHEN** the eval kind is configured for Fly execution and the fix kind for host execution
- **THEN** doctor probes nothing about Docker and prints no Docker line, and reports the shared, eval, eval-fly, and fix-host groups

#### Scenario: Diagnose an unresolvable Fly image

- **WHEN** the eval kind is configured for Fly execution and the configured image cannot be resolved to a digest
- **THEN** doctor fails the eval-fly group naming the image and the action to take, and shows fix readiness independently

#### Scenario: Diagnose a missing host executable

- **WHEN** the fix kind is configured for host execution and `jq` is not on the service PATH
- **THEN** doctor reports the missing executable under the fix-host group with the action to take

#### Scenario: Diagnose Runner settings

- **WHEN** the operator's Runner user settings do not select the headless backend and yolo permission mode
- **THEN** doctor reports the fix-host problem and names the required values without changing the settings

#### Scenario: Report reclaimable Docker space

- **WHEN** a kind is configured for Docker execution, Docker is running, and it holds reclaimable images or build cache
- **THEN** doctor prints the reclaimable amount and the trim command and does not run it

#### Scenario: Pass a check

- **WHEN** a check passes
- **THEN** its line shows the result and no repair action

### Requirement: Expose current operational status

`agent-factory status` SHALL show, per work kind, the slot holder and progress, waiting work and why it waits, blocked fix claims, settled fix claims with eligible review comments waiting for the slot, pending merge syncs and their last failure reason, pause state, blocking conditions, and the next permitted start time when it can be determined. For an eval attempt under Fly execution it SHALL show the Machine identity, the Machine's state including whether it is stopped for a quota hold, and the attempt's recorded deadline; it SHALL also list Machines that reconciliation reported as unknown to the store or as failed cleanup. It SHALL list only claims that are running, waiting, blocked, held, in Review, pending a merge sync, or holding a recorded cleanup failure; claims whose card is Done with nothing pending, and superseded claims, SHALL be omitted unless `--all` is given, which lists every saved claim. It SHALL expose enough saved state to distinguish active execution, an admission-window wait, a usage hold, a memory or disk hold, an unavailable prerequisite, a blocked claim, a waiting review round, and unfinished reporting. Status SHALL remain usable while execution is active and SHALL NOT start work or change execution controls.

#### Scenario: Inspect an active evaluation

- **WHEN** the operator requests status while a repetition is running
- **THEN** status identifies the active request and repetition progress without interrupting execution

#### Scenario: Inspect waiting work

- **WHEN** work cannot start because the factory is paused, outside its window, or held by a prerequisite, memory, or usage limit
- **THEN** status explains the blocking condition and shows the next permitted start time where known
- **AND** it does not invent a recovery time for a problem requiring operator action

#### Scenario: Inspect both slots

- **WHEN** an eval is running and a fix is blocked awaiting input with the `needs-input` label
- **THEN** status shows the eval slot's holder, the fix slot as free, and the blocked bug with its decline reason

#### Scenario: Inspect a waiting review round

- **WHEN** a settled claim has eligible review comments but the fix slot is busy
- **THEN** status names the claim, the PR, and that it waits for the slot

#### Scenario: Inspect an installation with history

- **WHEN** the database holds many Done and superseded claims and one running claim
- **THEN** status lists the running claim and none of the settled ones
- **AND** `status --all` lists every saved claim

#### Scenario: Inspect a Fly attempt

- **WHEN** the operator requests status while an eval repetition runs in, or is stopped in, a Fly Machine
- **THEN** status shows the Machine identity, whether it is running or stopped for a quota hold, and the attempt's deadline

#### Scenario: Inspect a reconciliation finding

- **WHEN** reconciliation has reported a Machine unknown to the store or a cleanup that could not be verified
- **THEN** status lists that Machine and the reported reason until it is resolved

### Requirement: Document installation and service operation

The change SHALL provide installation, configuration, and service-management instructions for the supported Mac deployment, including Python/uv setup, required repositories, mirrors and working clones, Docker startup and memory allowance where Docker execution is used, the fix execution mode and what host mode keeps and gives up, the eval execution mode and what Fly execution keeps and gives up compared with Docker, model authentication, GitHub routing and board permissions, suite prerequisites, the packaged fix workflow and its contract version, explicit service paths including the LaunchAgent PATH, login behavior, preventing idle sleep, and the evidence retention period. For Fly execution the documentation SHALL cover the one-time Fly organization, app, and deploy-token setup, the amd64 base image build and the Runner revision it requires, each Fly setting and its default, that Cursor role profiles are unavailable on Fly, that the human-review command runs on the Mac against the collected artifact directory, that a lost Machine costs its repetition, and the worst-case cost per attempt implied by the deadline. Documentation SHALL state plainly that in host mode, on a machine where the operator's own GitHub login is available, the separate fix credential and the PR-only rulesets are conventions the launched process follows rather than boundaries an autonomous agent cannot cross, and that trusted-writer admission and human merge are the enforceable controls. Documentation SHALL explain doctor, status and `--all`, tick, pause, resume, service installation and restart, evidence locations including a host attempt's Runner session directory, the human-review handoff, the blocked-bug loop, and the merge sync. The GitHub setup documentation SHALL describe the harness setting as a branch resolved at admission, not a commit pin.

Credentials for the suite's candidate branch, the fix PR credential, the Fly deploy token, and board/routing credentials SHALL remain separately configured. Public example configuration SHALL contain no personal credentials or machine-specific paths. The documentation SHALL distinguish installing a working Codagent example from extending the factory with another work-kind or suite implementation; it SHALL NOT imply that unsupported kinds execute through configuration alone.

#### Scenario: Set up the supported deployment

- **WHEN** an operator follows the installation instructions with the required credentials, suite behavior, and a Runner branch that can run the packaged fix workflow
- **THEN** the operator can configure the board and local service, diagnose readiness, start normal execution of both kinds, inspect progress, pause and resume work, run a posted human-review command, and review a factory fix PR

#### Scenario: Reuse the public example

- **WHEN** another organization follows the public setup documentation
- **THEN** it can substitute its own GitHub identities, credentials, and paths without relying on Paul's local environment
- **AND** the documentation clearly identifies any additional handler, suite, or workflow implementation needed for different work behavior

#### Scenario: Set up host execution

- **WHEN** an operator follows the instructions to run fixes on the host
- **THEN** the documentation tells them the setting, the doctor checks to pass, the PATH the service needs, what the sandbox guarantees they lose, and that the credential and ruleset are not enforceable against the agent

#### Scenario: Set up Fly execution

- **WHEN** an operator follows the instructions to run evals on Fly
- **THEN** the documentation tells them the Fly setup steps, the image build, the settings and defaults, the doctor checks to pass, the transport the service needs, what changes for human review, and what a lost Machine costs
